# CCI Arrows

CCI Arrows is an indicator for MT4 and MT5 by EarnForex.com. It is based on the standard CCI (Commodity Channel Index) indicator. It finds points where CCI crosses the zero level and marks those points with up and down arrows on the chart. This indicator supports all types of alerts.

The indicator draws its arrows in the main chart window, not in the separate window (where traditional CCI is displayed).

It is a non-repainting indicator but, unfortunately, it does lag considerably.
